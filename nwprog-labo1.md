# Labo 1: Bash Shell Scripting

## Tools

* Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to take notes
  * in-line `commands` between \`backticks\`
  * blocks with \```lang ... ```
  * apply syntax highlighting!
    * for scripts: lang=bash
    ```bash
    #! /usr/bin/env bash
    wtf(){
      shit="magic"
      echo "it's fucking ${shit}"
    }
    ```
    * for copied console sessions: lang=console
    ```console
    me@my-box:~ $ wtf
    it's fucking magic
    ```

* Use a sensible editor!
  * don't like `vim`, `emacs`? Set up VSCode w/ extensions BASH-IDE + SSH-FS
